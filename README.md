# Image Creation with GANs (Generative-Adversarial-Networks)

Networks that can create images that never existed themselves before (ie. exist only in our imagination). They learn about the world, objects, animals etc. and then create new versions of those objects.

Consists of a Generator (generates images) and Discriminator (Assesses those images and tells the generator whether or not the images are likely to be similar to what its actual in real world)
